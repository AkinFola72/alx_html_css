Headphones Design Web Page

Welcome to my Headphones Design Web Page project! This project is built entirely from scratch without using any external libraries or frameworks. It showcases a responsive and accessible web design using only HTML and CSS.

🚀 Project Description

This project is a culmination of foundational web development skills, putting into practice everything learned about HTML structure, semantic tags, styling with CSS, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility best practices. It demonstrates how to:

Structure a clean and semantic HTML5 document

Apply effective CSS styling without libraries or preprocessors

Make a fully responsive layout for different screen sizes

Implement accessibility features for a better user experience

🧰 Technologies Used
